      <h2>Bio:</h2>
      <p>Mae Carol Jemison (born October 17, 1956) is an American engineer, physician and NASA astronaut. She became the first
        African American woman to travel in space when she went into orbit aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on September
        12, 1992. After medical school and a brief general practice, Jemison served in the Peace Corps from 1985 until 1987,
        when she was selected by NASA to join the astronaut corps. She resigned from NASA in 1993 to found a company researching
        the application of technology to daily life. She has appeared on television several times, including as an actress
        in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. She is a dancer and holds nine honorary doctorates in science, engineering,
        letters, and the humanities. She is the current principal of the 100 Year Starship organization.</p>

      <h2>Career:</h2>
      <p>Jemison flew her only space mission from September 12 to 20, 1992, as a Mission Specialist on STS-47, a cooperative
        mission between the United States and Japan, as well as the 50th shuttle mission. Jemison was a co-investigator of
        two bone cell research experiments, one of 43 investigations that were done on STS-47. Jemison also conducted experiments
        on weightlessness and motion sickness on herself and six other crew members. "The first thing I saw from space was
        Chicago, my hometown," said Jemison. "I was working on the middeck where there aren't many windows, and as we passed
        over Chicago, the commander called me up to the flight deck. It was such a significant moment because since I was
        a little girl I had always assumed I would go into space," Jemison added. Despite NASA's rigid protocol, Jemison
        would begin each shift with a salute that only a Trekkie could appreciate. "Hailing frequencies open," she could
        be heard repeating throughout the eight-day mission.</p>

        <p>&ldquo; People always think of technology as something having silicon in it. But a pencil is technology. Any language
          is technology. Technology is a tool we use to accomplish a particular task and when one talks about appropriate
          technology in developing countries, appropriate may mean anything from fire to solar electricity. &rdquo;</p>
