# freeCodeCamp - Show the Local Weather
### Show the Local Weather Project for freeCodeCamp

**Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story:** I can see the weather in my current location.

**User Story:** I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

**User Story:** I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
